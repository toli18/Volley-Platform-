# Notes

Attempted to access the user-provided ChatGPT share link to reproduce instructions, but the request returned `403 Forbidden` from the outbound proxy. Unable to retrieve the linked content within this environment.

Re-tried with an explicit `curl -I https://chatgpt.com/share/69243508-85c4-800c-b902-0bde4ea5cc39` request and received the same 403 response from Envoy, which indicates the environment is blocked from fetching the shared conversation. Please provide the contents of the share link directly (e.g., as pasted text) so they can be incorporated here.
